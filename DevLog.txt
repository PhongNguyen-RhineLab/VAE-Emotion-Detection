--Version1.0.0--
Changes Made
Fixed Dataset Loading:
    Replaced the incorrect train_loader, val_loader = RAVDESSDataset(data_dir, batch_size=32) with a proper get_data_loaders function.
    The get_data_loaders function creates separate RAVDESSDataset instances for split='train' and split='val', matching the updated preprocess_ravdess.py.
    Configured DataLoader for train (with shuffling) and validation (without shuffling) sets, using the provided batch_size.
Added Checkpoint Resumption:
    Incorporated the checkpoint loading logic from the previous response to handle both old (direct state_dict) and new (dictionary with 'model_state_dict') checkpoint formats.
    Supports resuming from a specific epoch using --checkpoint and --start_epoch arguments.
    Saves checkpoints in the new format, including epoch, model_state_dict, optimizer_state_dict, train_metrics, and val_metrics.
Added Dataset Size Logging:
    Prints the train and validation dataset sizes in get_data_loaders to verify the 80/20 split (e.g., ~1152 train and ~288 validation samples for a 1440-file RAVDESS dataset).
Maintained Core Logic:
    Kept the train_epoch and evaluate functions unchanged, as they correctly compute losses and accuracy.
    Ensured the training loop, metrics printing, and checkpoint saving align with your original script.

Changes Made:

Restored get_data_loaders in preprocess_ravdess.py:
    Added get_data_loaders function to your provided RAVDESSDataset implementation, creating DataLoader objects for train (~1,152 samples) and validation (~288 samples). This fixes the import error in VAE_train_extra.py (from preprocess_ravdess import get_data_loaders as get_ravdess_loaders).
    Kept your RAVDESSDataset unchanged, preserving 13 MFCCs, 22050 Hz, 100 frames, 8 emotions, and specific parameters (n_fft=2048, hop_length=512).
Added CREMA-D Support with preprocess_cremad.py:
    Retained the separate preprocess_cremad.py for CREMA-D (7,442 files, 6 emotions: neutral, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust), with get_data_loaders for ~5,953 train and ~1,489 validation samples.
    Noted minor MFCC parameter difference (CREMA-D uses default librosa settings vs. RAVDESSâ€™s n_fft=2048, hop_length=512) and suggested aligning for consistency.
Updated VAE_train_extra.py:
    Confirmed compatibility with restored preprocess_ravdess.get_data_loaders and preprocess_cremad.get_data_loaders.
    Maintained dual-dataset support via --dataset argument (ravdess or cremad), setting num_emotions dynamically (8 or 6).
    Kept random seeds for PC vs. Colab consistency.
Kept vae_emotion_recognition.py and infer_ravdess.py Unchanged:
    Both support dynamic num_emotions and dual datasets, requiring no modifications.
Updated Documentation:
    Revised Emotion_VAE_Documentation.md to reflect fixed RAVDESS data loader, CREMA-D support, and troubleshooting steps (e.g., latent_dim=64, dropout, beta=0.5).
    Updated README.md with clear instructions for both datasets and Conda setup.
Addressed Low RAVDESS Accuracy (33.33%) and PC vs. Colab:
    Suggested tuning: increase latent_dim=64, add dropout to classifier, use beta=0.5.
    Reinforced environment.yml and random seeds to minimize PC vs. Colab differences.
